# About

In this application, a game was created to test the user's reflex time and decision making. This data was placed into SQL tables using the sequelize NPM package. On another page, a news API was used to get the headlines for the past 24 hours. This was displayed using masonry. Everything was done on the backend also. The last page contains a slideshow containing statistics. The site was displayed on Heroku. The link is https://badboys8597.herokuapp.com/
